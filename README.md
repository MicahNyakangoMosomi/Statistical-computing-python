- numpy==1.24.3  # For numerical operations and array handling
- matplotlib==3.10.3 For data visualization and plotting 



# Project Overview: 
This project investigates the socio-economic downturn that followed the 2007 Kenyan General Elections.  
Using time-series indicators such as **Quarterly GDP Growth** and **Tourism Revenue**, the study measures both the **magnitude** and **duration** of the national shock.

The workflow is organized into four structured folders, each aligned with a specific analytical role.

---

# **Folder Structure**

##  ** exploratory-data-analysis (Python)**  
Python handles:
- Data acquisition  
- Cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory summaries  
- Initial pattern discovery  

This stage builds the foundation for all later modeling and simulation by preparing high-quality inputs.



## **visualization (R)**  
R is used for:
- Time-series modeling (e.g., ARIMA)  
- Statistical diagnostics  
- High-clarity graphical outputs  

The visualizations illustrate the shock-and-recovery patterns revealed by the models.

---

## **simulation (Julia)**  
Julia focuses on:
- High-performance simulations  
- Recovery-trajectory modeling  
- Computational benchmarking  

These simulations help evaluate alternative recovery paths and understand system dynamics under stress.

---

## **additional_practice**  
This folder includes:
- Extra scripts  
- Experimental notebooks  
- Supplementary demonstrations  

It acts as a sandbox for extended practice and exploratory coding ideas beyond the main workflow.
